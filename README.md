## 📖 Overview
This project provides a robust, production-style batch analytics pipeline designed to process **2M+ Call Detail Records (CDRs)** at scale. Leveraging the Hadoop/Spark ecosystem and orchestrated by Apache Airflow, this pipeline ensures high-throughput data processing, effective data skew management, and automated job reporting.

## 🧠 System Design Decisions

- **Orchestration Logic**: We utilize Apache Airflow for DAG orchestration to provide fault-tolerant, retryable job execution. Using the `run_pipeline.sh` script as a CLI wrapper provides a clean interface that abstracts the Airflow DAG triggering logic.
- **Data Skew Strategy ("Whale Caller")**: A "whale caller" was introduced to the dataset, accounting for 10% of records. To handle this, the `anomalous_calls` job leverages Spark’s Window partition functions (`Window.partitionBy("caller_id")`). This ensures data locality, forcing the cluster to shuffle records by caller_id before processing, which prevents partial statistics calculations and memory hotspots on individual worker nodes.
- **Scalability**: By leveraging the Hadoop/Spark ecosystem via `docker-compose`, the pipeline is horizontally scalable. The design is optimized for large-scale enterprise workloads, such as revenue assurance and network analysis.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed on your machine.

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shanmuka-p/Hadoop-Based-Batch-Analytics.git
   cd Hadoop-Based-Batch-Analytics
   ```
2. **Ensure scripts are executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x run_pipeline.sh
   chmod +x data/generate_records.sh
   ```
3. **Start the infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
4. **Wait for all services** (Namenode, Spark, Airflow) to report a "healthy" status.

### Running the Pipeline
Use the provided `run_pipeline.sh` script to trigger specific analytics jobs:

```bash
./run_pipeline.sh top_callers
./run_pipeline.sh tower_heatmap
./run_pipeline.sh anomalous_calls
./run_pipeline.sh revenue_recon
```

## 📊 Execution Monitoring
Each job generates an `_MANIFEST.json` file in its respective output directory (e.g., `/output/top_callers_by_spend/{run_id}/_MANIFEST.json`). This file summarizes the execution metadata, including:
- **Job Name**
- **Run ID**
- **Input/Output paths**
- **Record counts**
- **Execution status**
